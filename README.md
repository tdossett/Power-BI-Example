# Power-BI-Example
This project contains several files used to demo a Power BI file with simple example of illustrating the use of mapping SQL Server database relationships within Power BI. It contains a Power BI file (OEE.pbx) that can be download and opened using Power BI Desktop or Power BI Server. In addtion there is an SQL Sever database backup file (OEE.bak) that can be restored to your local SQL Server instance (can use SSMS) and a pdf that contains a SQL Server database diagram (OEE database design) .
